# Replication Package for "LiSSA: Toward Generic Traceability Link Recovery through Retrieval-Augmented Generation"
This is the replication package for our paper "LiSSA: Toward Generic Traceability Link Recovery through Retrieval-Augmented Generation". This package contains the source code for the LiSSA tool, the dataset used in the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 21 + Maven 3
- Open AI subscription: API Key & Organization ID

## Structure of this Repository
* `LiSSA-RATLR-V1` contains the code and datasets used to create the results without the significance tests. It represents a former version of the tool (i.e., without features like seed definition)
* `LiSSA-RATLR-V2` contains the code and datasets used to create the results with the significance tests. It represents the most recent version of the tool (at the time of the paper).
* Note: The most recent version of the tool can be found at [ArDoCo/LiSSA-RATLR](https://github.com/ArDoCo/LiSSA-RATLR)
* In the current directory, you will also find some excel sheet that contain the tables of the evaluation results.
