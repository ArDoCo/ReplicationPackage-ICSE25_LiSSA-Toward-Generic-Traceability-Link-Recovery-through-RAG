# **R2C (Requirements to Code TLR) Analysis**

## **Files**

### **R Scripts**
- **`r2c_analysis.R`**
  - Performs Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing LiSSA and baseline approaches.
  - Computes effect sizes with confidence intervals.
  - Calculates mean and standard deviation for LiSSA approaches.
  - Saves results as CSV files.

### **CSV Output**
- **`r2c_wilcox_p_values.csv`** → Wilcoxon p-values for each metric.
- **`r2c_wilcox_eff_size_values.csv`** → Effect sizes with confidence intervals.
- **`r2c_mean_standard_derivation_values.csv`** → Mean ± standard deviation for LiSSA (one-row, no "Approach" column).
