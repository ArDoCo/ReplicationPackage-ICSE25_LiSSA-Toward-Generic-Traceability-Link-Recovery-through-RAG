"conceivable traceability link":
FN:
(20 because of LLM)

UC1,DBRefreshmentPoint: same topic but user view vs backend
UC13,DBTourist: UC describes single activity, target describes more broad feature set (not explicitly mentioning active/inactive) -> BeanTourist is used. BeanTourist has field "boolean active" -> maybe useful as context
	UC25,CulturalHeritageAgencyManager: Bean has "getRatingNumber(...), not exactly "statistics"
UC15,ControlData: "a conceivable traceability link could exist [...] <trace>no</trace>
	UC32,OperatorAgency: "not possible to definitively establish a traceability link", but also standard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
UC19,AdvertisemnetAgencyManager: UC talks about banner ads, source about news. based on title meant as news? -> "wrong" focus
UC22,ControllDataAdvertisement: standard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
UC24,RefreshmentPointAgencyManager: source contains "getFeedback(...)" but LLM does not talk about it -> information gets lost?
	UC25,RefreshmentPointCommonManager
UC33,DBTourist: LLM fails to make connection 

"The requirement does not explicitly mention any specific classes or methods"
"However, it is possible that the functionality described in the requirement could be implemented or validated using some of the methods"
"The source code does not specifically mention <...> as described in the requirement."

Wenn nicht ganz klar, wofür Methoden verwednet werden, dann möglicher vorstellbarer trace link
UC mentions actor, therefore class representing the actor is related (UC1,BeanOperatorAgency)
UC1,AdvacnedSearch: correctly recognizes a search ist done, doesn't interpret by whom the search is done
UC10,DBSearchPreference: UC10 mentions results of a search described in UC9
"<...> may cover scenarios such as <...>", "could be used for" -> "what could this be used for"

 

"traceability link":
FN:
UC42,DBDish: "The use case describes the functionality and flow of events for deleting a menu, while the source code implements methods for clearing, inserting, modifying, and retrieving dishes from a database."
"The requirement does not explicitly mention any specific classes or methods"

FP:
UC16,Tourist: standard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
UC26,DBRefreshmentPoint: modifiyRefreshmentPoint, therefore edit comment
!UC32,TagAgencyOperatorManager: "This method is likely related to handling the modification of data, which could include password changes."
	UC8,DBVisitPR
