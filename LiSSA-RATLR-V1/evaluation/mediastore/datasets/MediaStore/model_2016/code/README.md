NOTE: This is a mirror of the SVN repository that is mentioned below, but only with its implementation and model. You can find the rest in the SVN linked below.

The following is the documentation from the [SDQ-Wiki](https://sdq.kastel.kit.edu/wiki/Media_Store):

# MediaStore

Media Store is a Java EE based case study system. The most up-to-date version of Media Store is the third reincarnation, which is also used in the Palladio book. Its implementation and model can be found in our SVN (you can use anonymous:anonymous as credentials). The performance model is based on version 1.0 of the implementation.

The model that is held up-to-date with the current nightly build can be found in this branch: (though, it is not guaranteed to conform to the performance of the original model)
